# Neural Topology Optimization Via Active Learning for Efficient Channel Design in Turbulent Mass Transfer

The data and code for the paper [C. Kou, Y. Yin, M. Zhu, S. Jia, Y. Luo, X. Yuan, L. Lu. Neural Topology Optimization Via Active Learning for Efficient Channel Design in Turbulent Mass Transfer, *Advanced Science*, 2025](https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202508386).

## Data
- The training dataset of neural operators can be downloaded via [OneDrive](https://yaleedu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/lu_lu_yale_edu/EusjK0hAu0xJoLTxnrgafIkBSrjlbAd8h2tK_HB7b401nw?e=Zrcuzj). The dataset is generated by compiling [UDF.c](data_generation/UDF.c) and then running [fluent.cas](data_generation/fluent.cas).
- The raw experimental data can be found in [experiment_data](experiment_data).

## Code

All code are in the folder [src](src).
- Run the [train_GC.py](src/train_GC.py) and [train_GP.py](src/train_GP.py) to train the neural operators.
- Run the [main.py](src/main.py) to perform neural topology optimization using the pretrained nueral operators.
