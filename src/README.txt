1. Run 'train_GC' and 'train_GP' sequentially to train the GP and GC operators:
    If necessary, use `model_GC.py` and  `model_GP.py`  to modify the parameters of the neural operator.
2. Save the trained neural operators and use the `main` file to load them to implement the optimization algorithm.
